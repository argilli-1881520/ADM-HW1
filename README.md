# ADM-HW1

The `scripts.py` file contains all the code for both _Problem 1_ and _Problem 2_.

The file is structured in the following way:
```Python
# Section - Exercise name
"""Code"""

# Section - Exercise name 2
...

# ----- PROBLEM 2 - Algorithms ------

# Exercise name 
...

```
I completed every problem assigned, except for one in the "Strings" section.\
The `Homework1.pdf` file is the collection of all the submission sorted by challenge (to save space), as for some exercises I had a lot of tries before getting the solution.
